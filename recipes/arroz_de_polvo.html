    <h2 class="headings sub">Description</h2>

    <p>Arroz de Polvo features tender pieces of octopus simmered in a rich, flavorful tomato-based broth, combined with
        long-grain rice. The dish is often cooked to a malandrinho consistency—meaning the rice is slightly soupy or
        saucy, but not watery, similar to a wet risotto.</p>
    <p>The octopus is typically simmered until tender, sometimes pre-cooked and then added back to the dish. As the rice
        cooks, it absorbs the deep umami flavors of the broth and seafood, resulting in a rich and satisfying dish.</p>
    <p>Arroz de Polvo is typically served hot, often as a main course. It pairs well with a dry white Portuguese wine
        like Vinho Verde or a chilled rosé.</p>

    <h2 class="headings sub">Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1200g of octopus</li>
        <li>1 diced onion</li>
        <li>2 minced garlic cloves </li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>100ml of olive oil</li>
        <li>400g of rice</li>
        <li>Cilantro to taste</li>
        <li>2 peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 glass of white wine</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="headings sub">Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a pot, cook the octopus without water over low heat for 50 minutes to 1 hour. The octopus will cook in
            the water it releases naturally. Once cooked, cut it into small pieces.</li>
        <li>In a pot, make a sauté with the olive oil, onion, garlic, and bay leaves. Let it cook for a bit, then add
            the tomatoes cut into small cubes. Let everything sauté together.</li>
        <li>Add the rice and let it fry a little. Then add the wine, the octopus cooking water, and about 0.5L of water.
            Season with salt and pepper. Let it cook for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the octopus. Let it come to a boil, then add the chopped cilantro. Cover, turn off the heat, and let it
            sit for two minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
