    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Pastel de Nata is a famous Portuguese tart that features a caramelized custard made from egg yolks, sugar, milk,
        and cream, nestled in a delicate puff pastry shell. It's typically baked at a high temperature, which gives the
        custard its signature blistered surface and slightly caramelized flavor.</p>
    <p>Pastéis de Nata are best enjoyed warm, often dusted with a bit of cinnamon or powdered sugar, and paired with a
        cup of strong Portuguese coffee.</p>
    <p>This iconic treat has become one of Portugal's most beloved and exported desserts, found in bakeries around the
        world.</p>
