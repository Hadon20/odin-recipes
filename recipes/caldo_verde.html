    <h2 class="headings sub">Description</h2>

    <p>Caldo Verde is one of Portugal's most iconic and beloved soups, known for its simplicity, comfort, and deep
        cultural roots—especially in the northern regions like Minho.</p>
    <p>Caldo Verde is typically served hot, drizzled with a bit of extra virgin olive oil and accompanied by broa de
        milho (Portuguese cornbread). It's especially popular at family gatherings, festivals, and even after midnight
        on New Year's Eve.</p>
    <p>Despite its humble ingredients, Caldo Verde is rich in flavor and holds a cherished place in Portuguese culinary
        tradition as a symbol of warmth and home.</p>

    <h2 class="headings sub">Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>200g of Galega cabbage (a type of Portuguese collard green)</li>
        <li>1 Onion</li>
        <li>2 Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>600g of potatoes</li>
        <li>1 Salpicão or meat chouriço (Portuguese smoked sausage)</li>
        <li>50g Cornbread (Portuguese broa de milho)</li>
        <li>150ml Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="headings sub">Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes, onion, and garlic cloves, and cook them in 1.5 liters of water seasoned with salt, a
            drizzle of olive oil, and the chouriço. Meanwhile, prepare the cabbage leaves by washing them and cutting
            them into fine julienne strips.</li>
        <li>When the potatoes are well cooked, remove the chouriço and mash the rest (potatoes, onion, and garlic) with
            a fork or a potato masher. Return the mixture to the heat and, 10 minutes before serving, with the broth
            boiling, add the well-drained cabbage. Let it cook uncovered until the cabbage is tender.</li>
        <li>Adjust the seasoning and add the remaining olive oil.</li>
        <li>Slice the chouriço and place a slice in each bowl or serving plate. Pour the hot caldo verde over it. Cut
            the cornbread (broa) into slices to serve on the side.</li>
    </ol>
